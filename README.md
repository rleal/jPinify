This jQuery plugin is an experiment that tries to show several divs like famous Pinterest pin's page. Fixed width, flexible height and dinamic top position.
Needs some improvements and examples, sorry.  


An example html code to pinify

    <div id="pinList" class="row">
        <div class="pin">
            <img src="[photoURL]">
            <p> You can put more content </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pin">
            <img src="[photoURL]">
            <p> You can put more content </p>
        </div>
    </div>
